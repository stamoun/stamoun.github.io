# Welcome to My Web Site

I wanted to teach myself HTML/JS/CSS so here we are. I wanted a lightweight site as well as something easily maintainable; hence I did not use framework/libraries.

# TO DO

- Layout (section headers + links, mobile?)
- Footer
- Esthetic stuff (moving background?)
- Prog stuff section
- Doodles section
- Beer on tap, fermenting, on queue
- Dark theme support
- ~~Add a README :)~~
